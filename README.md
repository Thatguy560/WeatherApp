This is a simple weather application that utilises the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows a user to type in a location and see the current temperature and weather conditions of any country. I wanted to make a few projects with the objective of practising React.

# Visit the deployed app

You can find the deployed app via the following link: https://Thatguy560.github.io/WeatherApp

# Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. type "git clone https://github.com/Thatguy560/WeatherApp.git" in the terminal

3. cd into 'WeatherApp' (Change directory's)

4. npm install

# Getting an API Key and Usage

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org) and generate a new API Key, your API key should then be emailed to you.

2. Open the .env file (if you haven't got an .env file create one by typing in the terminal 'touch .env'), copy and paste your newly generated API key after the = (e.g. "REACT_APP_API_KEY=ig4fv45qvlq6sg6awfvarrtf5omlvnyt
   "). The API key in my case was 32 characters long but this may vary for each person.

# Using The App

1. Open up a terminal in your text editor and type 'npm start'

2. This should then automatically open the app on your browser, however if it doesn't just open up any browser of your choosing and type in the url "http://localhost:3000/".

3. Once the page is loaded you can then search for any location of your choice. It will show you the current temperature, weather conditions, what it feels like, wind speed and a different background picture depending on the conditions.
